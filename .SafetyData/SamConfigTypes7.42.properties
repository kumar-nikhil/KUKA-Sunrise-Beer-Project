201_LongDesc=This AMF is violated, if the monitored structure of the monitored kinematic system is not completely outside of the configured protected space.
202=Collision detection
202_ShortDesc=This AMF is violated, if the external torque of at least one axis of the monitored kinematic system exceeds the configured limit.
202_LongDesc=This AMF is violated, if the external torque of at least one axis of the monitored kinematic system exceeds the configured limit.
203=Tcp-force monitoring
203_ShortDesc=This AMF is violated, if the external force exerted on the tool of the monitored kinematic system exceeds the configured limit.
203_LongDesc=This AMF is violated, if the external force exerted on the tool of the monitored kinematic system exceeds the configured limit. If no tool is attached, the robot flange will be used as reference point.
204=Hand guiding device inactive
204_ShortDesc=This AMF is violated, if the hand guiding device is disabled or in panic state.
204_LongDesc=This AMF is violated, if the hand guiding device is disabled or in panic state.
205=Hand guiding device active
205_ShortDesc=This AMF is violated, if the hand guiding device is enabled. The AMF monitors the enabling device which is configured for the AMF "Hand guiding device inactive".
205_LongDesc=This AMF is violated, if the hand guiding device is enabled. The AMF monitors the enabling device which is configured for the AMF "Hand guiding device inactive".
206=Delay
206_ShortDesc=This AMF is violated, if the configured time is exceeded since the activation of the AMF.
206_LongDesc=This AMF is violated, if the configured time is exceeded since the activation of the AMF.
207=Tool orientation
207_ShortDesc=This AMF is violated, if the tool orientation of the monitored kinematic system exceeds the configured limit.
207_LongDesc=This AMF is violated, if the tool orientation of the monitored kinematic system exceeds the configured limit. The permitted area is defined by the operating angle and the reference vector in the world coordinate system. The reference vector results from the rotation of the Z unity vector by the ZYX-Eulerangles A, B, C.
208=Tool related velocity component
208_ShortDesc=This AMF is violated, if the cartesian translational velocity of the tool point of the monitored kinematic system exceeds the configured limit.

209=Base related TCP-force component
209_ShortDesc=This AMF is violated, if the configured component of the external force exerted on the tool of the monitored kinematic system exceeds the configured limit.
209_LongDesc=This AMF is violated, if the configured component of the external force exerted on the tool of the monitored kinematic system exceeds the configured limit. The configured component is relative to a reference frame, which results from the rotating the base frame by the ZYX-Eulerangles A, B, C.
